@ApiModelProperty

While swagger-core will introspect fields and setters/getters, it will also read and process JAXB annotations.
The @ApiModelProperty allows controlling Swagger-specific definitions such as allowed values, and additional notes. 
It also offers additional filtering properties in case you want to hide the property in certain scenarios.
